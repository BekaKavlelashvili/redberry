# Redberry Boutique Website

Static concept site inspired by high-end multi-brand jewelry boutiques, tailored for the Redberry label.

## Project structure

- `index.html` – single-page layout showcasing collections, designers, services, and contact touchpoints.
- `css/style.css` – global styling, layout grids, responsive breakpoints, and component treatments.
- `js/main.js` – lightweight navigation toggle for mobile experience.
- `assets/` – placeholder directory for future imagery and media.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the directory with your preferred static file server to explore the site locally.
